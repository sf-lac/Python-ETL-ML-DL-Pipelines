Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 microliter reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK-2, 1 nM JAK-3, 7 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK-1.

The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1x binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 34 uL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 uL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hr, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 uM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min.
