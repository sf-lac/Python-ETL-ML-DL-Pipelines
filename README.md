## ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è Pipelines

- __`1.`__ End-to-End ETL pipeline for extraction, processing and querying semi-structured clinicaltrials.gov data using __xmltodict__, __json__, __pandas__, __mysql-connector-python__ libraries, __SQL__ and __MySQL__ RDBMS.

- __`2.`__ End-to-End data analysis & ML pipeline for in/out patient treatment prediction using Electonic Health Records (EHR) laboratory tests results and demographics Kaggle dataset leveraging __pandas__ for data manipulation, __scikit-learn__ for data preprocessing, feature selection, dataset spliting, LogisticRegressionCV model training, evaluation and prediction, and __plotly__ for analysis and visualization of prediction accuracy.

- __`3.`__ End-to-End ETL & ML pipeline encompassing data extraction from web services, data curation, dataset creation, and predictive modeling of drug candidates' bioactivity using __pandas__, __SQLAlchemy__, __scikit-learn__ RandomForestRegressor/GridSearchCV modeling, and __XGBoost__ XGBClassifier/hyperopt modeling. 

- __`4.`__ End-to-End data processing & DL pipeline for prediction of solubility of drugs using __pandas__, __scikit-learn__ for data normalization, __TensorFlow-Keras Sequential API__ for deep learning (fully-connected neural network, regression), and __LIME__ for model interpretability (qualitative understanding between input features and prediction response).
