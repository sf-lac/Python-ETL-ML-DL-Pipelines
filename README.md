## ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è Pipelines

- __`1.`__ __`End-to-End ETL pipeline`__ for extraction, processing and querying semi-structured `clinicaltrials.gov` data using __xmltodict, json, pandas, mysql-connector-python libraries, SQL and MySQL RDBMS__.

- __`2.`__ __`End-to-End data analysis & ML pipeline`__ for in/out patient treatment prediction using `Electonic Health Records` (EHR) laboratory tests results and demographics Kaggle dataset leveraging __pandas__ for data manipulation, __scikit-learn__ for data preprocessing, feature selection, dataset spliting, LogisticRegressionCV model training, evaluation and prediction, and __plotly__ for analysis and visualization of prediction accuracy.

- __`3.`__ __`End-to-End ETL & ML pipeline`__ encompassing data extraction from web services, data curation, dataset creation, and predictive modeling of `drug candidates' bioactivity` using __pandas__, __SQLAlchemy__,__scikit-learn__ RandomForestRegressor/GridSearchCV modeling, and __XGBoost__ XGBClassifier/hyperopt modeling. 

- __`4.`__ __`End-to-End data processing & DL pipeline`__ for prediction of `solubility of drugs` using __pandas__, __scikit-learn__ for data normalization, __TensorFlow-Keras Sequential API__ for __deep learning__ (fully-connected neural network, regression), and __LIME__ for __model_interpretability__ (qualitative understanding between input features and prediction response).
